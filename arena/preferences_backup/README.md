This `preferences` folder is copied from the exhibit computer post projection mapping. 
The folder on the exhibit computer is located at: `~/Documents/Resolume Arena 5/preferences`

If a preference file becomes corrupted on the exhibit computer, you can copy these "clean" preference files back into place, which control the configuration of on-site projection mapping and other important settings/preferences. 
If changes are made directly on the exhibit computer, please overwrite this folder with the new Resolume preference files.
